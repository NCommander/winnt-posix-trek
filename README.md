## Trek for Windows NT POSIX Environment

This is my build of the bsdgames trek game for the Windows POSIX environment.

The Makefile included is intended to build with NMAKE from the Win32 environment,
using the NT Resource Kit, SDK, and Visual C++ 6. This should build on any version
of the POSIX environment with any version of Visual C++ with relatively minimal tweaks.
